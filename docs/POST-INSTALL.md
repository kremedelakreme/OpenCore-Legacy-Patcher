## Booting without USB drive

Once you've installed macOS through OpenCore, you can boot up and go through the regular install process. To boot without the USB drive plugged in is quite simple:

* Download OpenCore Legacy Patcher
* Change Patcher settings as you'd like
* Build OpenCore again
* Install OpenCore to internal drive
* Reboot holding Option, and select the internal EFI

And voila! No more USB drive required

## Booting seamlessly without Verbose or OpenCore Picker

To do this, run the OpenCore Patcher and head to Patcher Settings:

| GUI Settings | TUI Settings
| :--- | :--- |

Here you can change different patcher settings, however the main interest is:

* Set ShowPicker Mode

Once you've toggled them both off, build your OpenCore EFI once again and install to your desired drive. Now to show the OpenCore selector, you can simply hold down the "ESC" key while clicking on EFI boot, then you can release the "ESC" key when you see the cursor arrow at the top left.

## Enabling SIP

For many users, SIP will be enabled by default on build. For Intel HD 4000 users, you may have noticed that SIP is partially disabled. This is to ensure full compatibility with macOS Monterey and allow seamless booting between it and older OSes. However for users who do not plan to boot Monterey, you can re-enable under Patcher Settings.

Note: Machines with non-Metal GPUs cannot enable SIP in Big Sur either due to patched root volume

| SIP Enabled | SIP Lowered (Root Patching) | SIP Disabled |

::: warning 

If you're unsure whether you should enable SIP, leave as-is. Systems where you have already ran the Post Install Root Patching cannot enable SIP without potentially breaking the current install.

## Applying Post Install Volume Patches

For users with unsupported GPUs/wifi cards, you'll need to run the Post Install Root Volume patches to regain functionality. See below on whether your hardware needs root volume patching. 

* Hint: Try running the root volume patch option, the Patcher will determine and install patches only when required. So there is no harm in applying them

::: warning

Root Patching requires a network connection by default to grab associated resources. If your system is having difficulties with wifi or ethernet, grab the Offline variants of the patcher on Github next to the regular apps:
